# Executive Summary #

In this unit you will begin by learning about file compression, with hands-on experience compressing your previous scalable vector graphic file. Then you will move onto the main section of this unit, all about Object-Oriented Programming. You will read plenty and write some code, creating your own class, and objects to work within it. You will conclude by learning about how OOP systems are represented in diagrams through the Unified Modeling Language in order to communicate universally with others about the design of your programs, irrespective of the language you choose to use.

# File Compression #

  * File compression is used to pack multiple files all together into one easily-accessible file. This can be used to email many documents, instead of one-by-one, in one neatly packed compressed file. In addition to that, compression literally compressed the files, making them take up less space, thereby being easier to move around and handle.

When compressing the .svg file, the compressed folder was almost 4 times smaller than the original file. This property of compression may not happen when dealing with .jpg images, because those files are already compressed.

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) #

  * The Shark class is defined as a class to print out text about sharks and it has two methods. The methods are simply functions that work within the class and become essentially part of the class, as its capabilities. The Shark class in the instructional material has a method to state that the Shark is swimming, and another to state how it is being awesome.

  * A Constructor Method is a special function that is defined in the beginning of a class to begin using the class with some data already. This is useful if the methods you plan to use depend on the program defining something first, so you can use the constructor method to automatically have that information defined before any of your functions using the class are called.

  * A class is a set of rules and for objects to follow, and objects are pieces of code that operate within the rules of a class. The methods of a class are the aforementioned rules. For example, all strings can be modified with string methods to perform all.sorts of operations because strings are a class with rules, and they operate within those confines. When a programmer defines an object within a class, the programmer is instantiating an object from the class. This means they are using the class, in a particular instance, for their specific goals through the object they defined.

# Unified Modeling Language (UML) #

  * The Object Management Group (OMG) is similar to the W3C, in that it oversees the development of important standards to be used by the world so that we are all on the same page, but it is for design and object-oriented systems, not the interconnected systems. The OMG manages UML, the Unified Management Language, which is a set of rules and confines to determine universal object-oriented design standards.The purpose of UML is to create systems for design, analysis, and implementation to be used across all agencies, increasing the rate of development for everyone.

  * Sammy is an object, it is code that is defined in the class, to follow its rules
  * Shark is the class, the set of rules all object within it follow
  * A specific type of shark is an example of inheritance. It has all the properties of a shark and then it has its own addition unique qualities
  * The definition of a shark is an abstraction. It defines the behavior of an object, a real world entity.
  * The code “swim(self)” is encapsulation. The “self,” which refers to the object which is calling upon the method, is encapsulated within the swim method.

# Conclusion #

This unit was quite a mix for me. I found file compression pretty easy to work with and loved learning about OOP, and programming my own class. I had seen OOP thrown around here and there and never understood what it meant or why it was important. But I struggled with UML. The diagrams just didn’t really click and the terminology was all a bit fuzzy. I tried my best, and I hope to get a better understanding as I continue to work with these topics.
