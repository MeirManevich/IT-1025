# File Compression #

  * File compression is used to pack multiple files all together into one easily-accessible file. This can be used to email many documents, instead of one-by-one, in one neatly packed compressed file. In addition to that, compression literally compressed the files, making them take up less space, thereby being easier to move around and handle.

  * When compressing the .svg file, the compressed folder was almost 4 times smaller than the original file. This property of compression may not happen when dealing with .jpg images, because those files are already compressed.
