# Executive Summary #

# Python IDLE #

* There are a couple of ways to go about programming in Python. Using the shell program or text editor will both allow you to run Python programs, but in different ways. 
	* The shell editor executes each line you write, as you write it. This is very useful for tinkering around and trying out new lines of code on the fly. 
  * But for writing a longer program, a text editor is more useful, because it doesn't try to execute any of the lines you write. You can write for as long as you want to, and when you are done, if you save the file with the .py extension, you will be able to run the code as a program by opening it with python. 
  * The key way to differentiate between the shell and a text editor is that the shell always has a ‘>>>’ before each line, whereas a text editor does not.

### Code Examples  ###
* Variables are containers of information, representing whatever is assigned to them, quite like variables in math. For example, “variableTest = 7” means that “variableTest” is now a container for the number 7. Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, infused his language with a Monty Python theme because he was reading scripts for “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” at the time he was creating Python. Silly variables such as “spam,” “bacon,” and “eggs” are common exemplary variables, inspired by the Monty Python skit called, “Spam.” 

* An assignment statement is what gives a variable its value. In Python, the = operator is used to denote assignment. So “variableTest = 7” doesn't read “variableTest is equal to 7” but rather “variableTest now holds the value of 7.”

* A function is a command that Python will execute. For example the “print()” function will make the computer type whatever is contained in the argument of the function, contained in the parentheses.
* Three data types:
  * Integer: Integers, written as “int” in Python are all non-decimal numbers
  * Floating-point: Floating-point numbers, written as “float” in Python, are all the numbers with decimals.
  * String: Strings, writing as “str” in Python, are sequences of text. Enclose any text you want as a string in quotations to let Python know you want to make a string, even if it has numbers in it.
