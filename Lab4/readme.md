### Python Shell vs. File Editor ###
* There are a couple of ways to go about programming in Python. Using the shell program or text editor will both allow you to run Python programs, but in different ways. The shell editor executes each line you write, as you write it. This si very useful for tinkering around and trying out new lines of code on the fly. But for writing a longer program, a text editor is more useful, because it doesn't try to execute any of the lines you write. You can write for as long as you want to, and when you are done, if you save the file with the .py extension, you will be able to run the code as a program by opening it with python.
