# Executive Summary #

After learning all about the basics of the internet, it is now time to explore how its pages work! In this Unit you will learn about IP addresses and how webpages have security, you will program your first web page and add some style to it with color and formatting, and you will learn about URLs to get a better understanding of file paths.

# Internet Architecture #

### Internet Protocol ###

  * IP Addresses
An Internet Protocol Address is a series of numbers unique to a user of the internet. Every single internet device has one and the way devices communicate over the internet is by sending and receiving information between different address holders. IPv4 had around four billion available addresses until we used them all up, so now we use IPv6, which allows up to 340 undecillion addresses, a number beyond human comprehension. We will not run out of addresses any time soon.

  * ICANN
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a global nonprofit in charge of organizing internet addresses and ensuring compatibility with each other. They are in charge of distributing new IP addresses and without them, the World Wide Web wouldn’t be World Wide.

### TCP/IP ###

  * The Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a protocol for the information sent over the internet. It is a set of rules that all computers must follow to participate in the Internet, detailing how to send and receive information. It is analogous to a client-server model, where the client is the internet user and when the user wants information, they are requesting information from the server with another computer listening for requests, and when they connect, the request is carried out.

  * Layered protocol stacks provide future-proofing for changes made to the system. Instead of the protocol getting upset at the changes made and refusing to carry out the requests, layering allows each layer to act independently of each other, so the changes don’t affect the overall result and from the protocol’s perspective, nothing has changed. In practical implementation, the TCP/IP protocol uses a 4-layer stack system to ensure smooth running.

### Internet Security ###

  * Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the most widely used protocol on the internet, used to transfer plain text between computers. Nearly every website uses HTTP to display their webpages, and since everyone uses it, the client-server model is held up well, allowing all computers to understand each other, to send and view each other's webpages.
  * SSL and TSL are both security protocols used with HTTP to secure the information being transferred when it is flowing publicly along the internet. They both use public key encryption to render information into incomprehensible strings of characters that only the receiving computer can decipher, thus securing the information. Secure websites are denoted with an “s” as in “HTTPS.”

### Securing Your Web Browser ###

  * Securing your browser is important to maintain control of your computer. Connecting to the internet means allowing the possibility of outside forces gaining access or even control of your computer so it is worth your time to secure your browser, your portal to the internet. One such risk is disguised links, where there is a button that says you should click it, but it is a phishing link and immediately downloads viruses onto your computer. This can be prevented by not allowing any page to download anything automatically.

# Internet Programming #

### World Wide Web Consortium ###

  * Tim Berner-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989, and he was the one who coined the term. He wrote the first version of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and the browser. To help improve the World Wide Web, he founded the W3C, an organization responsible for developing critical tools and software and specifications for furthering the development of the Web.

  * One of the most important developed standards is the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) standard. SVG allows the user an incredibly high level of customizability without losing any quality, as there isn't an image which is manipulated, rather, a set of parameters for each computer to regenerate the image from scratch. This allows the scalability of the images, allowing them to be any size without losing quality.

### HTML5 and CSS ###

   * To create my webpage, I used HTML and CSS. HTML allowed me to lay out the very basics of the page, the foundations and the structural skeleton. Using CSS, I was able to then style the webpage a bit, using colors and borders to give the page my own personal flair. I took a fairly simple approach and didn’t stray far from the instructions, ensuring I would have success in my programming.

### HTML and XML ###

  * Although similar in appearance, XML is not an alternative to HTML. XML simply stores information in tags and containers, but it does not have the capability to display any of it. HTML or another program is required to display the information stored in an XML file.

# Components of a URL #

| Term        | Example     | Explanation |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Scheme      | https       | Type of address	|
| Domain | www.amazon.com     | Specific address of a page|
| Top Level domain | .edu    | The organization that the site belongs to |
| Default page | No file path provided| The page that displayed when no file path is included in the URL |
| Parameters  | Result of search | Critical information pertaining to the user’s search|
| Anchor  | Specific location on a page | Opens page at a specific point, useful for long pages|

  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PKr_BVo4hg is an example with these elements:
    * https is the scheme
    * www.youtube.com/watch is the domain
    * The top level domain is .com
    * The default page would open the youtube homepage with personalized results for each user.
    * The parameters are ?v=4PKr_BVo4hg
    * This page doesn’t have an anchor, but if it did, it may look like: #video_desciption

# Conclusion #

I found this Unit enjoyable, the best part being programming the webpage, consistent with my previous enjoyment of programming sections in this course. I found the information about the IP addresses interesting and felt secure learning about the protocols in place to protect me when using the internet. I don’t know if I will continue to pursue website programming, but I can see the appeal!
