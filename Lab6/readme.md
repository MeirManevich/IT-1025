### Internet Protocol ###

  * IP Addresses
An Internet Protocol Address is a series of numbers unique to a user of the internet. Every single internet device has one and the way devices communicate over the internet is by sending and receiving information between different address holders. IPv4 had around four billion available addresses until we used them all up, so now we use IPv6, which allows up to 340 undecillion addresses, a number beyond human comprehension. We will not run out of addresses any time soon.

  * ICANN
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a global nonprofit in charge of organizing internet addresses and ensuring compatibility with each other. They are in charge of distributing new IP addresses and without them, the World Wide Web wouldn’t be World Wide.

### TCP/IP ###

  * The Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a protocol for the information sent over the internet. It is a set of rules that all computers must follow to participate in the Internet, detailing how to send and receive information. It is analogous to a client-server model, where the client is the internet user and when the user wants information, they are requesting information from the server with another computer listening for requests, and when they connect, the request is carried out.

  * Layered protocol stacks provide future-proofing for changes made to the system. Instead of the protocol getting upset at the changes made and refusing to carry out the requests, layering allows each layer to act independently of each other, so the changes don’t affect the overall result and from the protocol’s perspective, nothing has changed. In practical implementation, the TCP/IP protocol uses a 4-layer stack system to ensure smooth running.
