# Executive Summary #

In this Unit, you will take a break from the exciting realm of programming and creation, to focus on an important foundational topic which should always be at the forefront of any project you work on. Security. You will begin by learning how networks are designed and how they communicate with each other, and then move on to securing the information moving across those networks, to protect your data from prying eyes. This is essential to keeping your users safe.

# Data, Information and Knowledge #

### Relational Data ###

  * Data 

    * Data is bits of information with no context, like numbers in a vacuum or colors referring to no object.

    * Information is data with context, when context is applied to data. So numbers of moviegoers on a weekend or available colors at an art store.

    * Knowledge is the result of analysis and comprehension of information, like me, reading the textbook, synthesizing it in my head, and then writing down its ideas in my own words. I have knowledge on thai topic now

  * Database

    * 

### Big Data ###

  * The Four “V”s

    * Volume is the quantity of data available for use. Typically, the more data available for analysis, the better.
    * Variety is the diversity of data available. No matter the quantity, data is not very useful if it is only of one kind. Diverse data points provide more accuracy and insight.
    * Veracity is the level of trust data carries with it. The source of data is crucial to its veracity; unsourced data is worthless, and sketchy data sources make for tenuous conclusions.
    * Velocity is how quickly data can be synthesized and converted into useful information and billable products. In this day and age of instant-access and streaming, the window of time for the velocity data is instantaneous.

  * Various technologies have driven the increase of the need for big data, each building on each other. Streaming has driven the need for user data like demographics, so advertisers can effectively advertise their products to the right audiences. Search engines like Google have driven the need for all sorts of obscure datasets like time windows of browser usage, and probability of news scrolling and retention rate for layouts of search bars. All these data points provide Google with information on how to further optimize the internet searching experience for their users, giving them an edge over smaller browsers. Those data on retention become even more in-demand in video services like Youtube and TikTok, where audience retention is the key to making money. The longer the companies have eyeballs, the more ads they show, and the more money they make, so retention data is immensely useful, and ends of shaping what kind of videos are created in the first place



# Ethical and Legal Implications #


### Code of Ethics ###

  * A code of ethics is created to explicitly state rules to be followed by those whom it applies to. Because humans vary in experiences and ideas of what is normal, a code of ethics puts everyone on the same page and brings consistency and expectations to be met and standards to hold each other to. ACM created a code of ethics for computing because the advance of computing technology happened much faster than any regulation could be made concerning it, so people were downloading music that cost money in the store, and other activities like that. Since laws take time to make, ACM made a code of ethics to apply within its jurisdiction at the very least, to organize everyone working under them to all be on the same page about what was acceptable and not.

  * An Acceptable Use Policy is quite similar to Code of Ethics, in that it is also a list of rules to be followed within a governing entity. It appears to me that the difference between the two is that a code of ethics is a more broad document applying to the standards of digital technology, like the constitution, whereas an acceptable use policy is smaller, pertaining to using a particular service.

    * In the Twitter TOS (Terms of Service) document( https://twitter.com/en/tos ), they note that they have the right to deactivate your account at any time if they feel it is necessary. This is why people sometimes get banned from twitter and cannot do anything about it, because they agree to this condition by making an account in the first place.

# Conclusion #

As a lover of creativity and visuals, I found using Lucidchart to be my favorite part of this Unit. I recognize how important cybersecurity is, but it doesn’t particularly appeal to me. But using the Khan Academy interactive ciphers was pretty cool. I can see how people can enjoy sending each other encrypted messages and decrypting them by hand for fun. I am glad that there are other people who are interested though, so I can be safe and secure when I am using the internet. I am really looking forward to the next Units, to getting back into programming. I can see we will touch on HTML and some more Python, both of which excite me!
