# Hardware #


### Hard Drives and Memory ###
* Concerning a Hard Disk Drive, the term "Latency" refers to the time it takes for the information that has already been located to move in place under the head. A similar term,"Transfer Rate," refers to the capability of the hard drive itself to read and write data. The "Average Access Time" is what refers to the total time between a user request and when the requested data is available to the user.
  
* A Solid State Drive (SSD) is faster and more reliable than a Hard Disk Drive. The SSD has no moving parts, contrasting with the HDD's spinning platter and moving head. The lack of moving parts reduced the chances of hardware malfunction. To read and write data, the SSD uses a system similar to Random Access Memory, reading and writing data on memory and instantly accessing whatever the user needs when requests are made. When requesting data from an HDD, the platter needs to spin to correct position and then time the spinning with contact with the head. All this takes time, which results in slower speed for the user.
  
* The hard drive of a computer's read and write speeds are typically not fast enough to run the programs from, so the computer needs a memory bank from which to communicate back and forth at lightning speeds. Random Access Memory allows the computer to load data onto it temporarily from the hard drive to manipulate in real-time. If you use up all your RAM, data will need to be transferred back and forth from the hard drive to continue using the computer and this will create a bottleneck in the overall performance. So the more RAM a computer has installed, the faster the computer can manage many files and programs at once and continue to run smoothly.
  
* Some kinds of RAM will be able to perform faster than others. The difference between RAM that uses a 32 bit path and ones that use a 64 bit path is quite significant. 32 bit path RAM can only send out 32 bits per cycle, while the faster RAM can send out 64 bits per cycle. This increased output leads to much faster performance.
  
  
  
### ALU and the Control Unit ###

* The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) serves a critical purpose in the processes of the CPU. The Control Unit, which is the main hub giving instructions to the various components around it, will send different values to be computed by the ALU. The ALU will do as instructed, like add or compare different values and then output the new value or the status of the comparison to the bus where the Control Unit will take the new output and decide the next course of action.

### CPU, Input & Output ###

* Being at the self-checkout at a grocery store is an illustration of the relationship of the input and output of the CPU. Information about the groceries being bought is collected by the scanner and converted to binary before being sent to the CPU of the machine. The data is stored on the hard drive and then processed, before being output to the screen, where the computer prompts the shoppers to input more information to pay for their groceries. This cu=yle is repeated for the payment process and the output is printed in the form of a receipt.

### Logic Gates and Circuits ###

* At the heart of computer hardware are little circuits carrying current, and to perform calculations, they use boolean logic gates. Truth tables can be quite handy to demonstrate the possible outcomes of logic gates. A truth table will list all the possible combinations of inputs for a particular gate and alongside those inputs, the outputs that will result from those combinations. For example, an NAND gate can have two or more inputs and it will always return a true outcome until all the connected inputs are true. In contrast to this, the AND gate will always return false until all its inputs are true.

### IEEE: Ethically Aligned Design ###

* The IEEE is an organization focused on promoting technological innovation and for the benefit of humanity. Their contributions in this volatile field are critical to its development. Regulating the ethics surrounding the creation of new technologies keeps the users safe from being taken advantage of and their data, private.
