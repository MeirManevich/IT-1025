### Hard Drives and Memory ###

Explain
* the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive.
  * Latency is time for physical data to move. Transfer rate is the capability of the hard drives to move data
  
* how a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive.
  * Hard drive has a spining disk, slowere data speeds. SSD has no disk, much faster than HDD
  
* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?
  * More space to have tasks running simultaneusly. Less RAM means background tasks will be shut down and it will take longer to go back to them because they'll have to restart, and data-heavy tasks will be sluggish because the computer cannot load all the data at once to work with, thus slowing down your use of the computer. More RAM means no waiting time when jumping between apps or working with a lot of data because it can all be handled at the same time.
  
  * The difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths.
