### Hard Drives and Memory ###
* Concerning a Hard Disk Drive, the term "Latency" refers to the time it takes for the information that has already been located to move in place under the head. A similar term,"Trasfer Rate," refers to capability of the hard drive itself to read and write data. The "Average Access Time" is what referes to the total time between a user request and when the requested data is available to the user.
  
* A Solid State Drive (SSD) is faster and more reliable than a Hand Disk Drive. The SSD has no moving parts, contrasting with the HDD's spinning platter and moving head. The lack of moving parts reduced the chances of hardware malfunction. To read and write data, the SSD uses a similar system to Random Access Memory, reading and writing data on memory and instantly accessing whatever the user needs when requests are made. When requesting data from an HDD, the platter needs to spin to correct position and then time the spinning with contact with the head. All this takes time, which results in slower speed for the user.
  
* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?
  * More space to have tasks running simultaneusly. Less RAM means background tasks will be shut down and it will take longer to go back to them because they'll have to restart, and data-heavy tasks will be sluggish because the computer cannot load all the data at once to work with, thus slowing down your use of the computer. More RAM means no waiting time when jumping between apps or working with a lot of data because it can all be handled at the same time.
  
  * The difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths.
