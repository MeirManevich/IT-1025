# Information Systems Components #
We are surrounded by information systems in this modern world. Let's take a look at one hidden in plain sight, the computer mouse.
* ### Hardware ###
   * To start with, the mouse hardware is typically a small plastic object that fits nicely in your hand. A couple buttons and scroll wheel on top will complete the hardware package.
* ### Data ###
   * Most mice nowadays collect their data optically. An LED is projected onto your desk surface and a small computer chip records differences in the way the light is reflected back and converts this reflection data into vertical and horizontal movement. It then transmits this data to the computer. 
* ### Software ###
   * There is a tiny piece of software in every mouse to read the optical reflections and convert them to movement. There is additional software on computers to recieve the transmitted data from the mouse and convert it to actions intended by the user and pointer animations to give visual feedback to user.
* ### People ###
   * No data is collected or transmitted without a user to operate the hardware. These days nearly everyone is included in this category.
* ### Process ###
   * The entirety of the mouse process looks like this:
      1. The user moves the physical mouse to a desired location
      2. Software reads optical reflection differences and converts them to movement and then transmits this data to the computer
      3. The computer software reads this data and converts it to actions and visual feedback animations
# GitHub #
* ### Client-Server Architecture ###
   * GitHub uses this architecture as one of its main functions. Users can create pull requests and the host of a repository can commit those requests and implement changes. Using GitHub Desktop assigns your computer the role of a client in this architecture.
* ### Cloud Computing ###
   * GitHub is a cloud computing service, referring to how all the resources shared within are hosted on remote computers and servers. Users intereact with GitHub to change and add files in this "cloud" from anywhere in the world.
# Conclusion #
   * This lab has been a new and enjoyable experience. I have started to familiarize myself with the GitHub workflow, markdown language is enjoyable and easy to use, and learning about the history and rapid ascent of information systems was enriching. I look forward to everything else we will learn in this course!
