# Software #

### Application ###
  * Application software consists of the programs most people are familiar with. Applications are usually designed to provide a specific service or achieve a specific goal. Some of the most popular applications include Microsoft Word, VLC Media Player, and Google Chrome.

### Utility ###
  * Utility software is less popular than application software, but maybe just as important. Programs in this category can add, modify, and delete other software on your computer, and even defend computers from malware. Norton and McAfee are antivirus programs, designed to protect computers from malicious software.

### Operating System ###
  * Regardless of what kind of software you use on your computer, none of it would be possible without an Operating System. The operating system of a computer is the layer upon which the rest of the experience is built. It graphically displays a representation of what the hardware is doing, allows the users to manage the hardware to their preferences, and it provides a platform for developers to create new programs. Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system in the world, followed by Apple's MacOS.

### ERP ###
  * For large companies, like Microsoft and Apple, or even smaller businesses, an Enterprise Resource Planning program is essential to their success. To keep track of many different employee schedules and various financial transactions all happening at once, an ERP provides a company with one piece of software to maintain it all. An ERP is based on a database which is then used for all the companies needs, adding and changing information within already-existing categories instead of creating overlapping ones. With the advantage of a central database, an ERP can offer additional functionality to meet the company's needs, connecting it all to the main database. Using an ERP to merge the many needs of a company can use the available resources more efficiently, saving money and time as a result.

# Python #

Python is one of the most widely used and supported coding languages available. Part of that success is due to its small learning curve. Python is a pseudo-code language, meaning it consists of simple and minimalistic English in a brief and logical way. This feature lowers the barrier for entry and makes it easy to read and understand.

In addition to that, Python is an interpreted language, making it far easier to run. Typically, to use a program, the user needs to run the code through a compiler program to convert the code into binary for the computer to execute. Operating systems by default come with compilers to convert programs, but they don’t always know how to convert the code. Being an interpreted language, Python compiles the programmer’s code internally before running it, so the user isn’t reliant on the Operating System they’re using. This makes Python hassle-free when it comes to portability, ensuring the code runs as intended, no matter what device is being used.

# Career Exploration #

### College Central ###
I found that while there are many software engineer listings nearby, and many offer good salaries, they all expect degrees and years of experience, both of which I do not have. I found two internships under the listing “python” but they were both graduate-level internships, beyond my scope. I think for now I will focus on learning programming alongside taking computer science courses and in time I will build the necessary portofolio and skills to apply for one of the available jobs.

### Bureau of Labor Statistic ###
Looking at information about software developers confirmed my existing impressions. The field is growing at a much faster rate than the average and the pay is really good. I suspect those two affect each other; the demand for developers is higher due to the growing field, and the field continues to grow because of the new developers. I hope to join the workforce!

### Certifications ###
Certifications like the one provided by CompTIA are extremely handy to have on your resume. Having a CompTIA certification demonstrates to an interested employer that you have the skills to work in cyber-security. Contrasting with a degree from college which could signify that you just passed your exams and perhaps never applied your knowledge, passing the CompTIA exam means you have hands-on expertise to work practically in the field. This certification is valuable and earned only from dedicated time and effort.

There are other certifications like this one pertaining to other fields in software development. I may look into acquiring a Google certification for Python programming when I have enough expertise.

### Certificates ###
The Programming and Development Post-Degree Certificate looks quite interesting to me. It focuses on gaining a wide variety of knowledge about the software field and stresses the application of that knowledge. It sounds like you will come out of it a well-rounded individual, ready to work in any number of different sectors of the field.  My current plan is to continue my education and pursue a Bachelor’s of Science, majoring in Computer Science, so I don’t know if I can fit this certificate into that schedule, but maybe I will feel that continuing my degree is unnecessary and choose to complete this certificate instead.

###  Co-ops / Internships ###
I have already begun my journey to become “co-op ready”! I registered for a free Python course offered by Harvard and I started working on it this week. I have been loving learning how to code, and I really enjoy tinkering on my own and thinking critically to arrive at solutions to problems. I hope this course, along with additional extra-curricular courses I hope to take following this one, will make me co-op ready! I think a summer internship will be the perfect thing to get my toes wet. Having that experience will not only prepare me for what it will be like to be working as a full-time as a developer, but it will show my dedication to  schools I want to transfer to, and potentially open up scholarship opportunities.

### Industry Associations / Student Organizations ###
The Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) is a program that brings college students together and lets them compete in a real-world controlled simulation. The teams must defend their virtual system from incoming threats. This competition provides students hands-on experience with working as a team to protect a system, awarding the best performing team, which motivates the participants to work as hard as they can. This can be an invaluable experience for a budding cyber-security engineer, giving them a sense of just what they are capable of and what they need to work on.
