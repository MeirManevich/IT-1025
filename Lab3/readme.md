### Application ###
  * Application software consists of the programs most people are familiar with. Applications are usually designed to provide a specific service or achieve a specific goal. Some of the most popular applications include Microsoft Word, VLC Media Player, and Google Chrome.

### Utility ###
  * Utility software is less popular than application software, but maybe just as important. Programs in this category can add, modify, and delete other software on your computer, and even defend computers from malware. Norton and McAfee are antivirus programs, designed to protect computers from malicious software.

### Operating System ###
  * Regardless of what kind of software you use on your computer, none of it would be possible without an Operating System. The operating system of a computer is the layer upon which the rest of the experience is built. It graphically displays a representation of what the hardware is doing, allows the users to manage the hardware to their preferences, and it provides a platform for developers to create new programs. Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system in the world, followed by Apple's MacOS.

### ERP ###
  * For large companies, like Microsoft and Apple, or even smaller businesses, an Enterprise Resource Planning program is essential to their success. To keep track of many different employee schedules and various financial transactions all happening at once, an ERP provides a company with one piece of software to maintain it all. An ERP is based on a database which is then used for all the companies needs, adding and changing information within already-existing categories instead of creating overlapping ones. With the advantage of a central database, an ERP can offer additional functionality to meet the company's needs, connecting it all to the main database. Using an ERP to merge the many needs of a company can use the available resources more efficiently, saving money and time as a result.
